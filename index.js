/* The Match Making Game

Do a 4x4 grid = 16 cards = 8 matches

Click two cards at a time and it should tell you if they are matched

If they are a match then they should disappear and the player gets the point

    The image should just change from the front of a card to the back of the card

If it's not a match the cards remain and they try again. 

    If you pick the wrong card you lose a life. 
    
    If you pick the right ones you gain a life. 


Two people playing the game and they take turns guessing.
